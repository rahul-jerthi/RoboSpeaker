# RoboSpeaker

Certainly! The provided code is a simple program called "RoboSpeaker 1.0.1" that utilizes the pyttsx3 library to convert text into speech. Let's go through the code step by step:

1. The code begins with a print statement that displays a welcome message, indicating the version of the program and the creator's name.

2. The next line initializes the pyttsx3 engine by calling the `init()` function. This function sets up the speech synthesis engine.

3. The code then enters a while loop, which will continue running until the user enters 'q' to quit the program.

4. Inside the loop, the user is prompted to enter the text they want the program to speak. The `input()` function is used to capture the user's input, which is stored in the variable `x`.

5. The code checks if the user entered 'q' (lowercased). If so, the break statement is executed, which terminates the while loop and exits the program.

6. If the user didn't enter 'q', the code continues execution. The next line, `engine.say(x)`, instructs the pyttsx3 engine to convert the text stored in `x` into speech.

7. The `engine.runAndWait()` function is called to initiate the speech synthesis process and wait until the speech is completed before moving to the next iteration of the loop.

8. The loop repeats, prompting the user for more text to be spoken, until the user enters 'q' to quit the program.

In summary, this code creates a text-to-speech program that allows the user to enter text, and the program converts it into speech using pyttsx3. The speech is played back immediately after the user enters the text. The program continues to prompt the user for text until the user decides to quit by entering 'q'.
